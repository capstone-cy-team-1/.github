# CY Capstone Project By Team 1

## Project 

This project is intended to apply the MITRE ATT&CK framework and tools to map a cyber incident and then use the Caldera tool to complete an emulation plan. Included into team's tasks is the deployment in the Cloud of a mock-up scenario that represents the system compromised in the cyberincident studied. 

As a result of the project, with the Adversary Emulation Plan is needed to elaborate Threat Report of the incident analized (including a STIX2.1 JSON representation).
